**Details about the parts needed are below:**

Here are the 3 printed components needed for this to work:
- The main arduino housing: https://thangs.com/mythangs/file/698372
- The arduino housing lid: https://thangs.com/mythangs/file/698373
- The distance sensor mount: https://thangs.com/mythangs/file/596516

The main mount is connected where the QR code is on the X-bar extrusion of the Ender-3, using the stock screws. 
The arduino mounts inside the lid via friction, and the lid mounts onto the main body using four (4) M3 screws (any length). 
The sensor mount is secured onto the hotend under the fan screw.
